The queue is to think of a queue as a line of people who are waiting for service. The newcomer goes to the end of the queue while the person who was at
the beginning gets service.

Queue is using first in first out principle(FIFO).

There are two fundamental operations for the queue: Enqueue() and Dequeue().

queue.Enqueue() means insert the item at the end of the queue. queue.Dequeue() means remove the last item from the beginning of the queue and returns
the removed item.
