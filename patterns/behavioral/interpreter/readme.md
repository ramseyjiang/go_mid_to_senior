The Interpreter pattern is widely used to solve business cases where it's useful to have a language to perform common operations. The pattern involves
creating a set of algorithm classes that are used to solve logical puzzles.

Objectives

Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It can be used to build a language for a specific problem domain, and then use that language
to write programs or scripts that solve problems in that domain.

Pros

1. Provides a way to create a language for a specific problem domain.
2. Can be used to write programs or scripts that solve problems in that domain.
3. Provides a flexible and extensible solution for complex parsing and interpreting tasks.

Cons

1. Complex to implement, especially for more complex languages.
2. be less efficient than other approaches to parsing and interpreting, such as compiler-based approaches.

How to implement

1. Define the grammar: This involves creating a set of classes that represent the grammar rules.
2. Create the expression classes: These classes implement the grammar rules. They should have an interpret method that takes an input and produces an
   output.
3. Build the parse tree: After you done the step 2, use them to build a parse tree that represents the input language.
4. Interpret the input: Finally, use the parse tree to interpret the input and produce an output.
