The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior based on its internal state. It allows an object to change
its behavior without changing its class, by delegating the responsibility of behavior to different state objects. The State pattern promotes loose
coupling, high cohesion, and easy maintenance of the codebase.

Objectives

1. Separates the concerns of an object's behavior from its state.
2. Provides a clear separation of concerns between an object and its behavior.
3. Improves the reusability and flexibility of the code, which are essential qualities of well-designed software.

Pros

1. Promotes better organization of the codebase.
2. Simplifies code maintenance by separating behavior from state.
3. Increases the modularity and reusability of the code.
4. Promotes a clear separation of concerns and reduces the complexity of the codebase.
5. Supports the Open/Closed principle, which allows for easy extension of behavior without modifying the existing code.

Cons

1. Leads to an increase in the number of classes and objects, which can make the code more complex.
2. Be difficult choose the right level of granularity for states, which can impact performance.
3. Be difficult to choose the right strategy for transitioning between states, which can impact the efficiency of the code.

How to Implement

1. Identify the object whose behavior needs to be changed based on its internal state.
2. Define an interface for the different states that the object can be in.
3. Implement the different states as concrete types that implement the state interface.
4. Add a reference to the state interface in the object whose behavior needs to be changed.
5. Implement methods in the object that delegate the responsibility of behavior to the state interface.
6. Implement methods in the state types that modify the behavior of the object.
7. Define methods for transitioning between the different states.
