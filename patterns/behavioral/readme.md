Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the
algorithm vary independently of clients that use it. The Strategy pattern is probably the easiest to understand of the Behavioral patterns.
