Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the
algorithm vary independently of clients that use it. The Strategy pattern is probably the easiest to understand of the Behavioral patterns.

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler
decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain

Command is a behavioral design pattern that allows encapsulating a request or operation as an object. It converts requests or simple operations into a
stand-alone object that can be stored, passed, and executed independently of the original requester. The pattern separates the requester (client) from
the object that performs the action (receiver). This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution,
and support undoable operations.
