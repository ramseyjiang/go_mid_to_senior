Barrier design pattern is a very common concurrency pattern, especially when we have to wait for more than one response from different Goroutines before
letting the program continue

Future design pattern is a concurrency pattern that allows us to write an algorithm that will be executed eventually in time (or not) by the same
Goroutine or a different one.

Pipeline design pattern is a powerful concurrency pattern to build complex synchronous flows of Goroutines that are connected with each other according
to some logic.
