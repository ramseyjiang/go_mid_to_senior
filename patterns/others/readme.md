The Aggregate pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a way to manage a collection of objects as a single unit. The key idea behind the
Aggregate pattern is to encapsulate a collection of objects into a single object, which is referred to as an aggregate root. The aggregate root acts as
the entry point for client code to interact with the objects in the collection, and provides a way to manage the consistency of the objects in the
collection.

The Pipes and Filters pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a way to process a series of tasks, where each task is performed by a
separate component (or filter) in the system. The filters are connected together in a pipeline, where the output of one filter is fed into the input of
the next filter. This allows the system to process data through a series of stages, each stage performing a specific task on the data.

The Private Class Data pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a way to encapsulate the data of a class and restrict access to that data
from outside the class. The idea behind the pattern is to make the data of a class private, and to provide getter and setter methods for accessing that
data. This allows the class to control how the data is accessed and modified, and helps to maintain the integrity of the data.
