**What's the Option pattern?**
Option pattern is used to provide optional arguments to a function that can be used to modify its behavior.

In Golang, it does not allow to set a default value for a function parameter. So this way, it is a good example. 
But if you want to use this way, you should consider your scenario, because this way adds more work for code and not good maintainable.

Perhaps it can be used as types convert function.
