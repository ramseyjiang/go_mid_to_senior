Structural patterns, as the name implies, help us to shape our applications with commonly used structures and relationships. Structural design patterns
explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with it as if it was a singular
object. It that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects. In this pattern,
you can treat all objects as the same via the common interface.

Adapter pattern which allows incompatible objects/interfaces to collaborate. It is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that
another object can understand it. Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces
collaborate.

Bridge pattern that lets you divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently. The Bridge
pattern lets you replace the implementation object inside the abstraction. The Bridge pattern tries to decouple things as usual with design patterns. It
decouples abstraction an object from its implementation the thing that the object does.
