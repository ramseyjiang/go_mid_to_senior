Structural patterns, as the name implies, help us to shape our applications with commonly used structures and relationships. Structural
design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with the it as if it was a
singular object. It that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual
objects. In this pattern, you can treat all objects as the same via the common interface.
