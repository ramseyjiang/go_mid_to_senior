there are several middleware functions that are commonly used in web applications, including:

Authentication middleware: This middleware checks whether the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested resource.

Logging middleware: This middleware logs information about incoming requests, including request method, URL, headers, and response status.

Error handling middleware: This middleware catches errors that occur during request handling and returns an appropriate error response to the client.

Request validation middleware: This middleware validates incoming requests to ensure that they meet certain criteria, such as HTTP method, headers,
query parameters, and request body content.

Caching middleware: This middleware caches responses to certain requests to improve performance and reduce server load.

Request Tracing: This middleware is used to trace the path of a request through a web application. It captures relevant information about the request
and logs it for monitoring and debugging purposes.
