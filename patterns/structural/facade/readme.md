The facade pattern is a design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or subsystems. It is used to hide the
complexity of the system and to provide an easy-to-use interface to the clients. The facade pattern is also known as a wrapper or an interface pattern.

Facade scenarios

1. When you want to decrease the complexity of some parts of our code, using the facade by providing a more easy-to-use method.
2. When you want to group actions in a single place.
3. When you want to build a library so that others can use your products without worrying about how it all works.

For example, Check account, Check security PIN, Credit/debit balance, Send notification, and so on.

How to Implement

1. Check whether itâ€™s possible to provide a simpler interface than what an existing subsystem already provides.
2. Declare and implement this interface in a new facade class.
3. To get the full benefit from the pattern, make all the client code communicate with the subsystem only via the facade.
4. If the facade becomes too big, consider extracting part of its behavior to a new, refined facade class.

Pros: You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

Cons: A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.

Facade is similar to Proxy in that both buffer a complex entity and initialize it on its own. Unlike Facade, Proxy has the same interface as its service
object, which makes them interchangeable.
