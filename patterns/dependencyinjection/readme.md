Dependency injection pattern in golang can be achieved through the use of container libraries such as wire and go-micro.

These libraries provide a way to automatically resolve and manage dependencies, making it easier to write and maintain
large applications.

Wire The wire is a code generation tool for Go that generates code for wiring up dependencies. It works by taking a Go
program with structs that have wire struct tags and generating the necessary code to wire those structs together.

Go-micro The go-micro is a more comprehensive framework for microservices development. The go-micro is based on the
go-micro library, which can be used for Dependency Injection, Configuration Management, Transport, Codec, Router, Load
Balance, Circuit Breaker, etc.

wire and go-micro are both powerful libraries for managing dependencies and providing dependency injection in Go. wire
is more focused on generating code for wiring dependencies, whereas go-micro is a more comprehensive framework for
microservices development and provide additional features like configuration management, transport, codec and more. With
these libraries, it is possible to improve the flexibility and maintainability of large Go applications by automating
the process of resolving and wiring dependencies.
