Dependency Injection is one of the most important design principles for keeping software “loose-coupling and easy to maintain”.
This principle is widely used in all kind of development platforms and there are many excellent tools related to it.

Pros of using wire:
1. Because wire uses code generation, the resulting container code is obvious and readable.
2. Easy debug. If any dependency is missing or being unused, an error will be reported during compiling.

Cors of using wire:
Not all developers will follow wire rules to generate file using command line.
It is hard to avoid developers updating wire_gen.go file.

If wire is not installed, when you run "wire", it will have error "could not import github.com/google/wire (invalid package name: "")".

So, firstly, please install wire:
% go get -d github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire

The last and an important one, you should add "// +build wireinject" at the top of wire.go.
If not, you will see a "redeclared" issue.
After you add "// +build wireinject", it will generate a line "//go:build wireinject" above on the line "// +build wireinject", if you
use GoLand.

The final step, run "wire" command in the wire folder, it will generate wire_gen.go automatically.

Some common advantages are:
1. Other services. Making your code more modular, less duplicate code and more testable.

2. Configuration. Such as a database passwords, API URL endpoints, etc.

3. System or environment state.
Such as the clock or file system. This comes in extremely important when writing tests that depend on time or random data.

4. Stubs of external APIs.
So that API requests can be mocked within the system during tests to keep things stable and quick.

There are some kinds of dependency injection, and each one has its own use case.
For example, Constructor, Property and, Method (or Setter).

The most common kind is the Constructor Injection. It allows you to make your implementation immutable,
nothing can change the dependencies (if your properties are private). Also, it requires all dependencies to be ready to create something.
If they aren’t, it usually will generate an error.

// Constructor Injection
func NewMyInjection(logger MyLogger, repo MyRepository, broker MyMessageBroker) *MyService {
    return &MyService{
        logger: logger,
        broker: broker,
        repository: repo,
    }
}

Property and Method injection are pretty similar, their adoption is a question of a language feature.

These kinds allow you to change dependencies in runtime, so by design, they aren’t immutable.
But if you need to change the implementation of some dependency, you don’t need to recreate everything. You can just override what you need.

// Method Injection
type MyService struct {
    logger      MyLogger
    broker      MyMessageBroker
    repository  MyRepository
}

func(s *MyService) SetLogger(logger MyLogger) {
    s.logger = logger
}

Some terminology:
1. A service is an instance of a class.

2. A container is a collection of services.

3. A singleton is an instance that is initialised once, but can be reused many times.
