Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing
code. Creational Patterns includes Singleton, Builder, Factory, Prototype, and Abstract Factory Design Patterns.

The Singleton pattern is one of the most used design patterns out there or one of the easiest to grasp. It will provide
a single instance of an object, and guarantee that there are no duplicates. At first, call to use the instance, if it's
created, and then reused between all the parts in the application that need to use the particular behavior.

The Builder pattern helps us construct complex objects without directly instantiating their struct, or writing the logic
they require. It will reuse an algorithm to create many implementations of an interface. It means the builder pattern
will allow you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. The builder
pattern's instance will provide the opening and closing braces {} and leaving the instance with zero values, or as
complex as an object that needs to make some API calls, check states, and create objects for its fields.

The Factory pattern is called Factory method pattern also. It is probably the second-best known and used design pattern in the industry. The
Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. The interface also
eases the process of downgrading or upgrading of the implementation of the underlying type if needed.

The Abstract pattern is called Abstract Factory pattern also. Abstract pattern is used to solve the problem of creating entire product
families without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product
creation to concrete factory classes. Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.

we have seen the differences when approaching the same problem with two different solutionsâ€“the Abstract factory and the Builder pattern. As
you have seen, with the Builder pattern, we had an unstructured list of objects (cars with motorbikes in the same factory). Also, we
encouraged reusing the building algorithm in the Builder pattern. In the Abstract factory, we have a very structured list of vehicles (the
factory for motorbikes and a factory for cars). We also didn't mix the creation of cars with motorbikes, providing more flexibility in the
creation process. The Abstract factory and Builder patterns can both resolve the same problem, but your particular needs will help you find
the slight differences that should lead you to take one solution or the other.
