Abstract pattern is used to solve the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an
interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes. Each factory type
corresponds to a certain product variety. Abstract pattern a new layer of grouping to achieve a bigger and more complex composite object,
which is used through its interfaces.

Objectives

1. Provide a new layer of encapsulation for Factory methods that return a common interface for all factories
2. Group common factories into a super Factory (also called a factory of factories)

Pros

1. You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
2. You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
3. Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
4. Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

Cons The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.

VehicleFactory is Abstract factory interface. It defines Build() method, but not implement it. Car is Concrete factory. Because they
implement Build(), and it defines NumDoors() also. Motorbike is Concrete factory. Because they implement Build(), and it defines
GetMotorbikeType() also. Vehicle is Abstract product, it defines NumWheels() and NumSeats(). FamilyCar and LuxuryCar are concrete products.
They implement NumWheels(), NumSeats() and NumDoors(). SportMotorbike and CruiseMotorbike are concrete products. They implement NumWheels(),
NumSeats() and GetMotorbikeType().

Vehicle: The interface that all objects in our factories must implement:

1. Motorbike: An interface for motorbikes of the types sport (one seat) and cruise (two seats).
2. Car: An interface for cars of types luxury (with four doors) and family (with five doors).

VehicleFactory: An interface (the Abstract Factory) to retrieve factories that implement the VehicleFactory method:

1. Motorbike Factory: A factory that implements the VehicleFactory interface to return vehicle that implements the Vehicle and Motorbike
   interfaces.
2. Car Factory: A factory that implements the VehicleFactory interface to return vehicles that implement the Vehicle and Car interfaces.

When you try to use abstract pattern, please check the below two points whether you have done.

1. The most essential thing is an abstract factory interface matches with at least one concrete factory.
2. The last thing is an abstract product matches with at least one concrete product.
