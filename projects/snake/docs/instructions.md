### Food 🍔

There are three types of food:

- Regular food ■
- Rat or Reduced speed 'R'
- Skull or Speed increse 'S'

**Regular food** ■ 

Regular food increses the length of the snake and will increse the score by 1.

Regular food spawns at a rate of 10/12.

**Rat 'R'** 🐀

A rat is the snake's favourite kind of food! The score will be incresed by 1 and the speed reduction will be handled by difficulty.

- Easy (-3 down to 8)
- Normal (-2 down to 12)
- Hard (-1 down to 20)

A rat has a 1/12 chance of spawning.

**Skull 'S'** 💀

A skull is not too good for the snake! The score will not be incresed but the speed will be incresed depending on your difficulty.

- Easy (+1 speed)
- Normal (+3 speed)
- Hard (+5 speed)

A skull has a 1/12 chance of spawning.
