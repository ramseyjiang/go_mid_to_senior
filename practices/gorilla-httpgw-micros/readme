This is a gateway example using gorilla framework.

Step 1: In terminal, in the project root path, execute:
$ docker-compose up -d
After all service start, you will see the following:
 ✔ auth-service                           Built                                                                                                                0.0s
 ✔ gateway                                Built                                                                                                                0.0s
 ✔ product-service                        Built                                                                                                                0.0s
 ✔ Network go-micros_mynet                Created                                                                                                              0.0s
 ✔ Container go-micros-auth-service-1     Started                                                                                                              0.3s
 ✔ Container go-micros-product-service-1  Started                                                                                                              0.3s
 ✔ Container go-micros-gateway-1          Started


Step 2: Run following commands in terminal,
You can access urls directly, otherwise you can access them through gateway.
Direct way,
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/login
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/register
curl -X GET http://localhost:8082/api/products/list

1.$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/api/auth/login
Return: {"error": "Invalid credentials"}%

2.$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/api/auth/login \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"username":"admin","password":"password"}'
Return: {"message": "Login successful!"}%

3.$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/api/products/list
Return: [{"id":1,"name":"iPhone 14","price":"999 USD"},{"id":2,"name":"MacBook Pro","price":"1999 USD"}]

4. $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/api/auth/register
Return: {"message": "User registered successfully!"}%


Step 3: Close all docker services:
In terminal, execute:
$ docker-compose down --rmi all -v
